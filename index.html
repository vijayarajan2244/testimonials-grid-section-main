                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for  the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12  weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”</p>

            <p class=" para5">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
              professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
              did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
              project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
              could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
              experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
              100% recommend! ”</p>
